\section{Optical Character Recognition Module}
Our application is integrated with the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. This capability allows users to easily convert text in images into editable text directly within the app. It is primarily demonstrated within the question posting section, for the users to post questions they found online or from the textbook. This enhancement draws inspiration from the Android-OCR project by Achmad Qomarudin.

For seamless image-to-text conversion, we've integrated TessBaseAPI into our system. Given the necessity for processing images locally, it's essential to have access to pre-trained data in the local environment. To achieve this, we provided an option to download the data file through a dedicated download manager, which operates within a CoroutineScope. This approach ensures that users has the freedom to choose not to download the additional resources, and if they are keen, they will be kept informed of the download progress via the UI. It's important to note that skipping the download will disable the OCR feature. The data will be verified each time the OCR activity initiates, and if the data is missing or corrupted, the download process will be automatically triggered again.

Given that images may contain unnecessary visual elements, we've incorporated a cropping tool. This tool, powered by the Android-Image-Cropper library, helps users isolate the text they wish to convert. This functionality is not limited to OCR; it's also implemented for profile picture uploads. User can zoom in and out, flip or rotate the image before it is processed.

To further boost the precision of our OCR, we've implemented basic image pre-processing. This includes adjusting the image's grayscale before conversion, to reduce the noise from the backgound. All temporary files are stored in local storage and will be automatically deleted once the activity finishes.

After the OCR function converts the image to text, the result text can be viewed and edited in a separate page, togather with the cropped image for reference. In this page, the image can be zoomed in and out, and move freely within the container, for user to reference to, in the event of them needing to edit the text recognised. If the user is satisfied with the result, upon clicking proceed button, the text will be automatically transferred to the caller activity within the application using the Intent putExtra method, and show in the respective text field. This ensures a smooth and efficient workflow, where users can easily view and verify the converted text, then quickly move from capturing or selecting an image to utilizing the extracted text in their posts or queries, enhancing the overall user experience.

User consent is crucial in mobile application, especially regarding the download of supplementary data as well as accessing the camera and gallery. All necessary permissions will be asked, including the right to download, open camera and access the photos, before carrying out the activities.

Dagger Hilt for dependency injection is implemented within the OCR module. Although the specifics of Dagger Hilt's application in this context might not be immediately apparent, it serves a critical role in simplifying dependency management. By using Dagger Hilt, we were able to streamline the process of providing dependencies for the OCR functionality, such as the TessBaseAPI and the download manager for training data. This not only makes the codebase modular and easier to maintain but also improves the scalability of our application.
