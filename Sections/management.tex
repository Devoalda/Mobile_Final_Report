\subsection{Sprint 2 Review and Retrospective}\label{sprint2_review_retrospective}
In Sprint 2, our team was dedicated to enriching the "Study Together" platform with key functionalities essential for fostering an environment of collaborative learning. This phase saw the rollout of several important features, such as the capability for users to pose questions, improved search functionalities, real-time chat, and the integration of AI-driven responses through WolframAlpha. A pivotal enhancement was the establishment of a basic notification system, a step forward in increasing user interaction with the platform.

Among the advancements, the implementation of the notification system stood out as particularly challenging. The complexity of developing this feature in Kotlin, a language that had not been extensively covered in our coursework up to that point, posed a significant hurdle. The intricacies of creating a service for notifications in Kotlin required the team to engage in self-directed learning and problem-solving, venturing beyond the classroom teachings to grasp the necessary concepts and techniques.

Moreover, refining the real-time chat feature proved to be a substantial task, as it demanded a delicate balance between sophisticated functionality and maintaining an intuitive user experience. These hurdles underscored the value of an iterative development approach and the utility of incorporating user feedback early and often in the development process. Such challenges brought to light the essential nature of continuous testing and adjustments, reinforcing the team's commitment to producing user-centric features that adhere to the lofty expectations for the platform. This sprint, with its blend of achievements and learning opportunities, emphasized the importance of flexibility and resilience in the face of technical challenges, guiding our approach to feature development moving forward.

Configuring the secrets property file to securely store the Gemini API key as an environment variable in the project's build config presented a significant challenge. Initially, the team encountered security concerns when attempting to store the key directly, prompting exploration of alternative secure storage methods. However, due to a lack of online documentation providing clear guidance on this specific task, the team had to rely on the closest available sample tutorial and conduct their own experiments to achieve a successful implementation.

% Team workflow and a description of the team's branching model and merging model %
\subsection{Team Workflow}\label{team_workflow}
Our team follows an agile workflow, utilizing the Scrum framework for project management. We conduct regular sprint planning meetings to prioritize tasks and set goals for each sprint. Daily stand-up meetings keep everyone in sync and allow us to discuss any blockers or issues that arise. At the end of each sprint, we hold sprint review meetings to demo completed work and gather feedback, followed by sprint retrospective meetings to reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

\subsection{Branching Model and Merging Model}\label{bm_mm}
For version control, we use Git and follow a branching model based on GitFlow. We have a main branch that reflects the production-ready code. For each new feature or bug fix, we create a feature branch from the main branch. Once the feature is completed, we merge the feature branch back into the main branch through a pull request. Code reviews are an integral part of our process, ensuring that all code changes meet our quality standards before being merged into the main branch.

Our merging model follows a strict protocol to maintain code integrity and stability. All pull requests must pass automated tests and receive approval from at least one other team member before being merged into our master branch.
